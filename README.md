# Ya-disk-browser-app

This is just a simple test app made to demonstrate my skils as a front-end developer.
This app connects to yandex disk rest api and shows its contents, so in order to use it, you should be registered on one of yandex services.

This app is made with React.js and Redux, bootstrap was used for styling.

### Installation and running

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to be installed.

1. Clone repository.
2. Navigate to root of a local clone and open command line tool.
3. In command line run:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```
This will start a local webpack-dev-server

 4. Open localhost:3000 in your browser.
 5. Have fun! :)
